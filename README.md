# dolphSol-Macro
A macro for the Roblox game "Sol's RNG", including features such as obby completion and item collection. A work in progress - DolphinBuilder



# Installation
First of all, you need to download AutoHotKey v1.1 (Not 2.0), and run the installer
Once complete, download the most recent version of dolphSol through the most recent GitHub Release (Download source code ZIP)
After downloading, extract the ZIP file to your desired directory
You can now run dolphSol through the Main.ahk file in the folder



# Features

dolphSol has a couple of different features it is capable of. These include:

Automatic Obby Completion, with an option to check if it is completed in case it has to be redone
Automatic Item Collection, with options to set which spots to collect from if sharing a server
Automatic Aura Equipping, so you can always have an aura equipped without an animation to ensure the macro performs well
Discord Webhook support
Reconnecting upon disconnect

# Fix

If your dolphin-builder paths haven't been working (and or aren't updated) then use the executable
version, this version has more features like a faster item-pickup time, VIP gamepass speed, 
and even a quicker disconnect / reconnect speed.
